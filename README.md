During my 4-week internship at CodTech IT Solutions, I worked on a real-time cloud computing project titled "Ticket Booking System using AWS S3 Cloud Storage." The primary goal of this task was to gain hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure, specifically Amazon Web Services (AWS), and learn how to host, configure, and manage a static web application using AWS S3.

This project allowed me to integrate web development skills with cloud storage technology by building a simple yet functional ticket booking platform using two main files — index.html and main.js. The entire application was deployed and hosted on AWS S3, which served as a static website hosting platform.

Project Overview: Ticket Booking System Hosted on AWS S3
The Ticket Booking System was a lightweight web-based application that enabled users to view available events, select seats, and confirm ticket bookings through a user-friendly interface. The UI was developed using HTML and interactive functionality was achieved using JavaScript through main.js.

Key Tasks Completed:
S3 Bucket Creation and Static Website Hosting:
Created an AWS S3 bucket and enabled static website hosting by configuring index.html as the entry point and optionally an error.html page for error handling.
Uploaded the index.html, main.js, and supporting assets (if any) directly into the bucket.
Frontend Development Using index.html and main.js:
Designed a responsive interface in index.html for users to view event listings and initiate the booking process.
Developed all interactive functionality — such as seat selection, form handling, and booking confirmation — within main.js.
Implemented client-side validations and dynamic DOM manipulation for a smooth user experience.
Cloud Storage Configuration:
Made use of AWS S3’s capabilities to host the application and serve content over the internet.
Ensured the proper folder structure and MIME type handling for all assets to work correctly in the browser.
Permissions and Security Settings:
Configured Bucket Policy to allow public access to the hosted static website while ensuring security best practices.
Verified access through the S3 website endpoint and tested the visibility of files.
Practiced secure content delivery by disabling open uploads and unnecessary permissions.
Testing and Validation:
Performed cross-browser and cross-device testing to ensure consistent behavior of the ticket booking functionality.
Used the AWS S3 static website URL to validate the deployment and access performance.
Documentation and Reporting:
Documented each step, from S3 setup to permission configuration.
Captured screenshots of the hosted site and S3 console as part of the deliverables.
Provided a walkthrough on how to use the booking system and manage the files on S3.

Skills and Knowledge Gained:
AWS S3: Learned how to create and configure S3 buckets, enable static website hosting, and manage bucket permissions.
Web Development: Gained experience integrating HTML and JavaScript for a functional UI/UX.
Cloud Security: Understood how to configure public access safely and use policies to control content visibility.
Deployment: Learned how to deploy static applications without using backend servers or traditional web hosting.
